// No runtime in KNOWN may grant itself blanket write permission.
//
// The web's permission model is per-worker AND per-CLI, but only the worker
// axis is written down: WRITE_CAPABLE_TOOLS and the per-kind deny lists live in
// claude-invocation.mjs, on Claude's path. So a CLI entry carrying a global
// auto-approve flag does not break a rule — it enters where the rule does not
// exist, and nothing goes red.
//
// The concrete failure: `pdf` has Bash explicitly denied (#2172). Pair a CLI
// with `--always-approve` and that same worker gets Write and Bash
// auto-approved, so the user's runtime choice silently changes what a worker
// may do to their files — with both paths identical in the UI.
//
// clis.ts is TypeScript and this test is .mjs, so KNOWN is read as text. Same
// deliberate choice as clis-coverage.test.mjs: a regex over the shipped source
// is enough to catch a forgotten flag and needs no build step.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/lib/clis-permissions.test.mjs
