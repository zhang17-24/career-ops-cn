// Every CLI with a documented headless invocation must be selectable in the web UI.
//
// This guards the drift that let Grok Build CLI go missing: it was wired into
// doctor.mjs (VALID_CLIS), the scaffolder, docs/SUPPORTED_CLIS.md, the README
// and .grok/skills/, yet KNOWN in web/src/lib/clis.ts never listed it — so the
// web UI silently could not run on it. Nothing tied the two lists together.
//
// clis.ts is TypeScript and these tests are .mjs, so KNOWN is read as text. That
// is deliberate: a regex over `bin: "..."` is enough to catch a forgotten entry,
// and it keeps the guard free of a build step.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/lib/clis-coverage.test.mjs
